 static const char *__doc_gr_aff3ct_codes_Resolve_Phase2 = R"doc(<+description of block+>

Constructor Specific Documentation:

Return a shared_ptr to a new instance of aff3ct_codes::Resolve_Phase2.

To avoid accidental use of raw pointers, aff3ct_codes::Resolve_Phase2's constructor is in a private implementation class. aff3ct_codes::Resolve_Phase2::make is the public interface for creating new instances.

Args:
    waveform : 
    frame_length : 
    buffer_length : 
    threshold : )doc";
